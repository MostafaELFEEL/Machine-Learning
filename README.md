## Gradient-Descent-
In this project we will use different Gradient Descent methods to determine local minimum of the given function:

The objective of this part is to find a solution for the following set of non-linear 
equations using different optimization techniques:-

We will use different Gradient Descent methods:-

1-Conventional Gradient Descent Method

2-Newton-Raphsonâ€™s Method

3-Line Search Gradient Descent (Steepest)
